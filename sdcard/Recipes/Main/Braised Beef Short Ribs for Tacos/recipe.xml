<describe>Heat the olive oil in a skillet on medium heat and brown the ribs on all sides.  Place the ribs and the onion in the inner basket and place the basket in the mixing bowl.  Add water to cover the ribs about halfway, but not over the maximum fill line. Add a generous pinch of salt.</describe>

<describe>Check the ribs to make sure theyâ€™re as tender as desired. They should be fork tender for slicing, or you can continue cooking for meat that falls apart for shredded beef tacos. 

Remove the basket from the bowl and remove the ribs. These are easier to slice if you refrigerate until chilled, then brown them in a pan for serving. Or, slice and serve while hot. 

The broth remaining in the pot can be strained and saved for use in soup. Serve the beef on tortillas with salsa, diced avocado, or your favorite topping
